# City Minor Hockey League Comparison - Alpena, MI vs. Racine, WI

## Motivation
For a previous course, I was tasked with doing minor analysis and creating a technical presentation based on this prompt:

The Federal Hockey League is attempting to expand it's Western Division. Locations have been narrowed down to Alpena, MI and Racine, WI. Which city is best for expansion?

This project showcases communication of data results pulled from multiple resources, including but not limited to the U.S. census. 

## Summary
The Federal Hockey League is attempting to expand its Western Division. Locations have been narrowed down to Alpena,MI and Racine, WI. The purpose of this report is to evaluate both locations and recommend which city is best for expansion. Minor league hockey teams have the most success in communities :
* That Are smaller and thriving
* With no current major league or university sports teams
* Predicted to be stable and/or growing (income/population)
* That have existing local dining options

Of the two locations, Racine, WI offers the most potential.
