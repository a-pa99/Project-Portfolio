# Zillow Web Scraping

Using the BeautifulSoup Python package, I web scraped one page of Zillow data for two cities: Boston, Massachusettes and Atlanta Georgia.
Data was scraped from these two cities to be used for housing price and type comparison. 
this project is ongoing and the following information will be added to the project soon:
- Visualizations using Tableau
- Code for web scraping multiple Zillow pages
